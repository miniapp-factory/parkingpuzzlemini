#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

I need to edit the app metadata file to change the title and description, and I’ll create a new file for the logo image.  
Please add the file `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A stylized quill pen writing on parchment, with swirling ink forming a storybook scene. The quill is silver with a feather tip, ink splashes create a subtle gradient from deep blue to rich burgundy. The parchment background has a warm, slightly textured look, giving a classic literary feel. The overall composition is balanced, with the quill centered and the ink forming a subtle, whimsical swirl that hints at storytelling and imagination.
